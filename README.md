To get a personal access token for GitHub, follow these steps:

Visit GitHub: Open your web browser and go to GitHub.

Access Personal Access Tokens:

Click on your profile picture in the top right corner. Select "Settings." Navigate to Developer Settings:

In the left sidebar, click on "Developer settings." Generate Token:

Click on "Personal access tokens" in the left sidebar. Click the "Generate token" button. Configure Token:

Enter a name for your token. Select the scopes (permissions) you need. For your script, you might need at least the "public_repo" scope if the repository is public. Click "Generate token" at the bottom of the page. Copy Token:

Copy the generated token immediately. This is the only time you'll see it. If you lose it, you'll need to generate a new one. Now you can use this personal access token in your script by replacing "TOKEN" with the actual token string.
