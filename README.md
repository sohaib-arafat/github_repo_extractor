To get a personal access token for GitHub, follow these steps:

Visit GitHub: Open your web browser and go to GitHub.

Sign In: Sign in to your GitHub account. If you don't have an account, you'll need to create one.

Access Personal Access Tokens:

Click on your profile picture in the top right corner. Select "Settings." Navigate to Developer Settings:

In the left sidebar, click on "Developer settings." Generate Token:

Click on "Personal access tokens" in the left sidebar. Click the "Generate token" button. Configure Token:

Enter a name for your token. Select the scopes (permissions) you need. For your script, you might need at least the "public_repo" scope if the repository is public. Click "Generate token" at the bottom of the page. Copy Token:

Copy the generated token immediately. This is the only time you'll see it. If you lose it, you'll need to generate a new one. Now you can use this personal access token in your script by replacing "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" with the actual token string.

Keep in mind the security implications of using personal access tokens. Treat them like passwords and don't share them publicly. If your script is handling sensitive information or interacting with private repositories, be cautious about where you store or share your access token.
